# FlutterFYP

FYP: A National Palliative Care App to Support Patients and their Multidisciplinary Teams

First project with Flutter. Backend: Spring Boot

Learned a lot in the given timeframe. First time coding declaratively. App lacks architecture similar to my prior knowledge of "promises" and JavaScript. Lots to fix and refactor but haved moved on to new projects.
